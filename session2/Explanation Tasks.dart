/*
1. Explain the purpose of the main function in Dart.

Answer: to determine the starting point of the program

2. Describe the difference between var, dynamic, and explicitly typed variables in Dart.

Answer: 
        var: determine the type from the first value 
        dynamic: the type is not fixed and can changed any time 
        dynamic is data type but var is keyword
        explicitly typed variables: You specify the type explicitly and not possible to change
